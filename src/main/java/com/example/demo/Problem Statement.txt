Create a project which will send messages (which contain some content and status
 - SUCCESS/ERROR) via RabbitMQ, the application should receive the message and send a 
 mail based on status. For example, if the status is SUCCESS, it should send mail of a
  specified template with the details of the content

If the status is ERROR, the mail should say that ERROR message received



These details should also be stored in your h2/postgres db, so for successful mails, 
save the details of the message, and the status

For messages with ERROR status, store the status.

There might also be issues with the mail sending, for example the template didn't get
 correct data, or the receiver's mail is not valid. In this case, the table should store
  that email was not sent for this message, and the reason why.
